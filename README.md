THIS APP IS BASICALLY A FOOD SAVIOUR,NO LITERALLY.

SO BASICALLY SUPPOSE YOU ARE ALONE AT HOME AND YOU ARE VERY HUNGRY,
YOU WANDER AROUND OPEN THE FRIDGE SEARCH THE KITCHEN AND THERE YOU DO FIND SOME STUFF,
SOME RANDOM STUFF.

SOME RANDOM STUFF AS IN YOU FIND MILK AT ONE CORNER AND BANANA AT THE OTHER END,
NOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM?

SO HERE COMES MY APP FOR THE RESCUE,
BASICALLY I HAVE A POOL OF INGRIDIENTS THE MOST COMMON ONE'S EASILY FOUND IN ANY KITCHEN
YOU JUST HAVE TO SELECT THOSE INGRIDIENTS AND THERE YOU GO...... 

YOU HAVE THE LIST OF ALL THE RECIPIES WHICH YOU CAN MAKE OUT OF THEM.
JUST CLICK ON WHICHEVER YOU WANT TO PREPARE FOR.

HOLLLLA!!!!! DISH READY WITH THE THINGS LEFT RANDOMLY :P
